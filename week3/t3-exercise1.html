<br><br>

<p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If<br>
the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group<br>
milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka<br>
jdavis_a, a resident of www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 homestead community<br>
on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using<br>
your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the<br>
Net for more such accounts!</p>

<p>Surprised? Or scared?</p>

<p><i>Formula:</i><br>
(a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br>
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got<br>
exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet<br>
and 23 online passwords.</p>
